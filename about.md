### Origins of Max Bikes West

After graduating high school, I fulfilled my dream of biking across
the country. I had toyed with the idea of making a blog, but never did anything
about it. However, putting together scraps of pictures and creative
interpretations of stories I had sent, my girlfriend and some of our friends
put together a wonderful satirical blog called [Max Bikes
West](https://maxkatzchristy.blogspot.com/). Every week, I eagerly awaited
another blog post to entertain myself on my ride.

I also shared this blog with my mom, at first without telling her that I hadn't
written it, who proudly shared it with all of her sisters, friends, the
mailman, etc. When I informed her that it was my girlfriend, she had to quickly
tell everyone that while it was loosely based on my stories, it was not in fact
something I had written.

Since that trip, I have gone on a few adventures, but I have trouble
remembering as many details as I would like. I took a class on memoir writing,
and wrote a couple essays about my cross country trip. I enjoyed writing these,
but was a bit frustrated about how uncertain I was about exactly what had
happened and didn't have the best pictures to back it all up. This blog is
meant to be a place where I can continuously add my travel stories for myself
and others to keep track of.

Why is it still called **Max Bikes West** if you also go other directions now?
It sounds nice. Most stuff is at least partially west of Boston...
