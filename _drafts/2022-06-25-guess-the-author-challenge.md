title: "Guess the author challenge"
---

Inspired by [Claire's initial blog for me](https://maxkatzchristy.blogspot.com/), I want to invite other people, if they feel so inclined, to write blog posts about my journeys, your journeys, or anything fictional in between. I will post these as part of a "guess the author" series, so all of my loyal readers can guess who wrote it. There are no constraints, besides that it has to be able to be posted on this blog. It doesn't have to be long, but I think it could be fun. If you want pictures to write based on, I can send them. You can also use prior uploaded pictures, if you like. I can make it multiple choice.

Have fun!
