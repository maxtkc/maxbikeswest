The bus dropped me off just short of Berlin, sun just under the horizon,
replaced by an almost full moon. I decided to get a little ways towards the
start of my route, riding almost 20 miles until I hit a dead end where my route
tries to take me on a private road. My bright lights were great for keeping
cars at bay, but we're little much when I took a wrong turn into a beach
parking lot and surprised some people who were enjoying the darkness and lake
without bathing suits. I quickly turned around, apologized, and decided to call
it a night.

I'm learning to hammock camp... The temperature are a bit tricky. I didn't
expect to actually need my sleeping bag, but I'm actually quite comfy in it.
Tomorrow and the next night I'm expecting some rain, so I'm going to need to
put up my fly properly with some rope so the rain doesn't pool or drip around
the fly and pool at my butt. I'm a little concerned it's not wide enough... But
we'll see. Every time I'm outside the hammock fiddling around it's open season
for the mosquitoes.

It's already light out, so I know I should get moving, but it's real cozy in
here. Goal is to do 120 miles today. I should get real close to the Canadian
border for a bit, hope I don't take a wrong turn because I didn't bring my
passport.
