fact, because I got lazy while biking, but I want this to be complete.

### Lisa, Hob, and Deb

I ran into three older cyclists heading South from Canada at a small store and
stopped to share lunch and ice cream with them. Hob and Deb met Lisa hiking on
the AT together. Hob and Deb had toured all over the place, often on tandem
together.

### My Parents Aren't Far Away

I ran into two cyclists before heading to the ferry to cross into Vermont and
approached them to ask how it went with bikes on the ferry. They told me they
had started that day in the town my parents had stayed in, who I was to meet up
with in Burlington a day later. I asked if they happened to see another couple
riding from there, and they said that they did. They then showed me a picture
they got with them and my parents! I took a picture with them to send back to
my mom.

The ferry was guided by a cable!

### Vermont

The Vermont side of lake Champlain is much less paved and more hilly, with many
more farms all over the place. I followed the Champlain Bikeway up the coast.

The sag in this bridge is not from distortion in the image... It may have once
been 13'

### Sandy

I stayed two nights at our family friend's cabin resting and waiting for my
parents to ride the rest of the way to Canada.

My parents arrived a day later.
