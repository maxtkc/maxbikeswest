Finally it's time to ride VTXL!! I've been looking forward to doing this route for a while.

Some notes:

- I'm going to hammock camp (I haven't done more than an overnight hammocking before
- it's going to be rainy I think
- I'm taking the bus up to Berlin, which adds 60 miles to get to the start of the route
