title: 'Concord Coach to the Start of VTXL'
---

Finally it's time to ride VTXL!! I've been looking forward to doing this route for a while.

[https://bikepacking.com/routes/vtxl/](https://bikepacking.com/routes/vtxl/)

Some notes:

- I'm going to hammock camp (I haven't done more than an overnight hammocking before
- it's going to be rainy I think
- I'm taking the bus up to Berlin, NH, which adds 60 miles to get to the start of the route
- I'm going to maybe take the commuter rail back from Wachusett or get a ride, so possibly another 100 miles on Tuesday

I managed to slide my bike on top of the wheelchair lift!
