title: 'Concord Coach To NH'
---

Finally it's time to ride VTXL!! I've been looking forward to doing this route for a while.

[https://bikepacking.com/routes/vtxl/](https://bikepacking.com/routes/vtxl/)

Some notes:

- I'm going to hammock camp (I haven't done more than an overnight hammocking before
- it's going to be rainy I think
- I'm taking the bus up to Berlin, NH, which adds 60 miles to get to the start of the route
- I'm going to maybe take the commuter rail back from Wachusett or get a ride, so possibly another 100 miles on Tuesday
- somehow I managed to pack everything into just my frame pack and seat pack!

~~Float~~Roll plan:
- Friday: 4pm bus to Berlin, NH. Bike? Sleep.
- Saturday: Bike to Canaan, VT. Bike South. Sleep.
- Sunday: Bike South. Sleep.
- Monday: Bike South. Return to MA? Sleep.
- Tuesday: Bike to Wachusett. Train home. Or get a ride. ðŸŽ†. Sleep.

Despite strange skepticism from the Concord Coach employees, my bike fit easily on the bus.

I talked to the person next to me on the bus, learned all about their life and plans, and they just got off. Buses give you a cool space to share tons of personal details with someone and then never see them again. It's a pretty big world, but with so many nice people.
