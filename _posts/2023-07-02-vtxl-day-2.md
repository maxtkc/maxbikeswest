After half bailing yesterday, this morning I wasn't really sure what I was
doing, and so I started tentatively on vtxl. It was raining pretty hard and the
back and forth of ideas and being unsure of where I was going led me to be
a combination of scared and stressed. It takes a lot of mental energy to figure
out where to sleep every night when traveling by bike, and rain adds a lot to
that (especially when you don't have the right gear for it). I just finished
the book "Utopia for Realists", and it discusses the idea of limited mental
bandwidth, and how lots of people can make all of the right decisions if they
have all the time in the world to think about it, but all of that thinking time
has a cost. I'm lucky to be able to spend my mental bandwidth on so many things
other than my daily survival and work.

Once I resolved to go to Hanover, the uncertainty vanished and all of a sudden
my mood changed to a strange cycling euphoria. I knew what I was doing and knew
I could do it, and the world felt lighter. On every bike trip, at least once,
I get a sort of chills over my body and I just feel fantastic, bursting with
energy and drive. Sometimes it's the first few pedal strokes in the morning,
sometimes the top of a climb, and sometimes meeting a person or seeing an
animal. There are a lot of ups and downs while touring, emotionally, physically
in Vermont especially, and sometimes I wonder why I'm doing it. But after every
trip, I always long to go back out on my bike, and I look fondly on both the
ups and downs, sometimes remembering even the downs fondly because of the
challenges they came with and because I have the peace of mind of the
resolution. I guess us humans are a bit stupid in that way.

I had to name the gpx file for the route `v2` because I have bailed out to Hanover before, last
time on a trip with my dad from Littleton, NH, also on Concord Coach and on
VTXL. This time it's my fault, and here is a short list of excuses:

- the air quality was bad, and my parents were very worried about my lungs
- the rain was way worse than I expected
- I don't trust my tent fly hammock setup fully in the rain. Why did I half test it at home and then bring it if I didn't really test it? I'm an optimist
- mosquitoes
- black flies
- I saw a bear and it was scary
- I saw a skunk and it was scary
- I just generally don't like camping in the rain
- mud is slippery and tiring
- my rear derailleur kinda goes into manual mode in the rain (I should figure out this issue)
- I'll come back and do it again sometime
- A package got delivered to my house today and I need to take it inside
- my Garmin kept bugging out

My route back to Hanover was actually on about 50% gravel anyways, which was
cool. I do like finding my own cool routes.

Why do I need excuses if it's my trip and I get to do what I want? Because
I set goals for myself and I like to achieve them. My plans rarely go as
planned, but it's always hard to let myself to stray from my original goals.

My bus drivers glasses just broke... Should I be worried?

> I have been informed that you can drive without glasses if you have
a specific type of vision issues. Interesting.

Had to change clothes before the bus ride. Used the 'change under the rain fly
and wash off in the spigot in the middle of a college campus' trick.
