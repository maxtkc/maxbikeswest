title: "NYC to Albany"
---

It's been a few days, and I haven't had much time to write, so here's a run down of the past few days.

### Bendits

After recuperating in the AC of the pizza place and finishing my lunch, I finally mustered up the courage to face the heat again and keep moving. The Bendits, my second cousins, live in Huntington, which I had just passed, but I had chatted with them and they were visiting more family in Mineola, which was not on my original route, but it didn't add too much time for me to add it in.

Their house was in a suburban neighborhood, with a big backyard. When I got there, they were just starting up the grill. We hung out outside and chatted about travel, and after about half an hour I mentioned I might have to keep going pretty soon to make it to Brooklyn by dark. Now, the Bendits, as many Jewish families do, follow the grand tradition of Jewish goodbye's, so it wasn't until a few more attempts and food offers and my second cousin telling her parents, "Mom, I think he really has to go," until I made it out.

The Bendits had mentioned that I would see some more traffic on my way out, as it was Sunday and people were coming back into the city. I was on the service road to the highway, which had been nice and calm before. When I got back on it, I witnessed a couple cars duking it out, somewhat physically, which ended in one of them throwing things off the bridge over the highway, and me switching to a different route.

### Connolly's

I stayed with the my cousins Dave and Irene in Brooklyn. I had dinner with them and their partners, and got to sleep in their roommates room because she was away. Her room both had AC, which was amazing, and a cat, who had some early morning routines, but other than that was amazing. Her name is fancy, and she wakes up with the sun and requires to be fed at that time. She also doesn't particularly enjoy when you fall back to sleep.

Guess who's shirt this is haha

### Short day

I stayed till around 3 in Brooklyn, doing laundry and waiting for the off and on rain to subside. When I found a break in the rain, I headed out, only to get poured on a couple miles in. It was a welcome change from the 90 degree heat of the day before. I took the Manhattan bridge over the water and started following signs for the west side. I was enjoying how easy it was to navigate Manhattan, because it's just a grid. When the west side signs told me to go south, I thought it would be easier to just stay straight because I wanted to go north in general, so I'd just make my own route from there. After a half hour of being surprised how wide Manhattan was, I noticed the signs saying East and West for the roads crossing the one I was on. When I checked my phone map, I noticed I was already halfway up Manhattan, and was 90 degrees away from where I thought I was.

The path along the west side of Manhattan was quite nice and there were not a lot of people, probably because of the weather. I did run into another touring cyclist named Grat from the Netherlands. He said he was going on the east coast Greenway to Boston and Portland Maine, before coming back to Boston and flying out of Logan. He had a lot of bags, so I rode with him for a bit and then left him when we got to some steeper parts.

As I was getting to the Schonfelds, only 33 miles from Brooklyn, I started to notice my front tire was starting to get a bit cushier, and I couldn't tell if it was the road or if I had lost air. I checked it when I got to the top of the hill, and I had definitely lost air, but I was only about ten minutes away. It was losing air slowly, and I didn't know from where, but I decided to try to make it all the way there. This proved to be a big mistake. On the turn onto the road they live on, my tire folded on itself, and I quickly hopped off and walked the rest of the way.

I managed to get a flat in my tire, but also a small hole in my side wall, which could not be plugged. I got close, but overnight it was not able to hold the seal, so after checking at 7 in the morning, I hung out by the pool with buddy until the bike shop opened at 10. Natalie kindly drove me over, and I was one of the first few customers.

The guy at the shop was either just a generally grumpy man or was having a tough morning. It seemed like he was very disappointed that he had customers. He sold a bike to this little boy in just a few minutes, and made an interesting attempt to be nice to the kid, saying, "this is *your* bike, so don't let anyone else ride it." He then, after taking my tire off and replacing it with a new one and charging me, told me that he wouldn't add sealant to my tire because my rim wasn't tubeless compatible. I finally convinced him to just go through with it, and he reluctantly followed through. Once we were able to escape the sour man's bike shop, I said goodbye to Natalie and was on my way to Kingston, NY, about 104 miles north on the Empire State Trail.

### To Kingston

Only thirty miles or so into my day, I started to hear a repeated clicking coming from my bike. Often this kind of noise was from my music, but when I paused that, I could still hear it. I stopped and slowly rolled my bike forward, checking my tires. I stopped when I saw the back of a nail in my rear tire. My rear tire wasn't leaking at all, so after considering my options, I decided it would be best to pull it out and plug it now, rather than later. I got a plug ready, and pulled out the nail, but before I plugged it I noticed it wasn't leaking very much, so I let it go for another few seconds and it started to seal itself. This is how tubeless is supposed to work, and after making sure it wasn't leaking at all, I could continue on my way.

About 60 miles in, I hear a cyclist come up alongside me. It's an older man on a road bike. He leads in, "Am I bothering you?" I have no idea what he's talking about, so I say no. "It helps you as well as me when I'm behind you." I think he's been drafting off of me, and I just hadn't noticed. "You get 7% and I get 25% reduction in resistance." I tell him that I don't mind at all, but we end up riding alongside each other for most of the time, chatting. He's from Westchester, and knows everything about biking everywhere along my route. He was a retired chemistry teacher and tutor for a high school and had retired at the start of the pandemic. He also liked to do Gran Fondo's, races usually between 80 and 120 miles long and told me he had gotten second at the triple bypass in Colorado.

> The ride travels over 3 mountain passes, 110-ish miles from Evergreen to Avon over Juniper Pass (11,140 ft), Loveland Pass (11,990 ft), and Vail Pass (10,560 ft), with over 10,000 ft of challenging elevation gain!

I mentioned to him that I rode over Loveland pass with my dad last summer, and he added that he had the fastest time on that section. He drafted a bit off of me, although we ended up chatting most of the 30 miles he rode with me.

Towards the end of my day, I crossed over the Hudson on a super long pedestrian bridge, probably the coolest bridge I've ever ridden over. I couldn't hear a single car and I could see miles and miles away into the distance. That night I was planning on staying in Kingston with a warm showers host, and I wanted to make it by dark, so could only stop briefly.

![IMG_20220628_175407]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/IMG_20220628_175407.jpg)

I switched to a gravel trail in New Paltz that took me past a few caves, wafting cold air over the trail giving me a break from the evening heat.

My warm showers host was a French man, Emmanuel, in Kingston, who texted me that he was out for a bit and to wait for him on the porch. He rolled up to his house riding a very dutch bicycle. He worked in IT and his house reflected it. His appliances were all very modern and fancy, motion detecting lights and top of the line washer and dryer. The rest of the house felt somewhat different, with many plants and a huge back window stretching all the way to the floor. I slept on a futon with a window facing the street.

### To Saratoga Springs

The next day, I got up early for my ride through Albany to Saratoga springs.

In Rensselaer, across the Hudson from Albany, I found a food truck selling sausages, a nice and quick stop
