fact, because I got lazy while biking, but I want this to be complete.

### Big Ride Back

Oops, I don't know how I keep getting stuff like this when I know I will
reliably feel sick riding after.

### A Fellow Max

I stayed with a WarmShowers host, Max, who had a rooftop grill next to the
rooftop pool at his apartment. We grilled salmon and it was fantastic.

He was a nice guy, just a little older than me, and we went to see the circus
and the jazz fest in the street later.

When I woke up in the morning, I enjoyed the view of the city from his balcony.

### Bougie Hostel

I stayed my second night at a hostel with not one, but two hot tubs on the
roof. There was also a fireworks competition that night and we could see it
from the roof!

Look at these fancy bunks with their fancy lights.

### Bus Home

In the morning, I lugged my bike in the box a few blocks to the bus station. At
one point, a man on his way to work assisted me down the block. The station
attendant was very kind and helped me, my overstuffed box, my exploding frame
pack, and my leftover Souvlaki.
