### I'm bad at reading schedules

I'm on the train to Providence right now with Nina, my sister. I was planning on biking the whole way from Boston, but I had read the wrong column on the ferry schedule. Nina fortunately noticed, so we have to get to get to Judith Point, where the ferry leaves, by 1:30 not 3. I was already going to have to leave quite early in the morning, and I don't want to have to rush too much.

As we walked down the platform with our bikes, an older Asian man who was clearly way cooler than us biked past, right up to the door of the train. We followed him on, and he motioned for us to put our bikes next to his, and sat at a seat next to the bikes, telling us he'd watch them for us. That man is currently asleep. It's the thought that counts.

### Fortunately no more schedules to read after today

Here's the plan:

- Boston, MA
- East Hampton, NY
- Brooklyn, NY
- Scarsdale, NY
- Kingston, NY
- Gansevoort, NY
- Charlotte, VT

Most of the days are just over 100 miles, except Brooklyn to Scarsdale, so maybe I can go do something in the city or hang out, or make any last minute repairs. I have people I can stay with in each of the places except Kingston, where I might camp or find a place at a hotel.

Trying not to socialize too much
