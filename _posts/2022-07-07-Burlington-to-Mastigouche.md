> Note: This post and future posts of this trip are written very much after the
fact, because I got lazy while biking, but I want this to be complete.

### Covered Bridge

Riding together!

### Burlington Causeway

There is a beautiful causeway that stretches out of Burlington North to the
Hero Islands in Lake Champlain, with a small gap that a ferry services in the
middle.

We didn't think to check the ferry schedule, but happened to catch the last
ferry, and only because it left late. Missing it would have been a very big
challenge, and I still have no idea what we would have done (swim?).

I don't know how we would swim this with my moms ebike...

### Canada

The town before the border had a lot of French speaking cyclists. And a very pretty view of the lake.

~~Biking~~Walking our bikes over the border.

So much flatter than Vermont!

Enjoying La Route Verte, Canada's bike route network.

I attempted to use some of my basic high school French speaking with our
WarmShowers hosts in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu

Turns out we were still connected to Lake Champlain!

### Montreal

Always nice when your parents take you out to dinner.

We stayed with another WarmShowers host on our way to Mastigouche. The husband
rode with us in the morning for the first part of the day.

### Mastigouche

If I was an HTTP packed, I'd be lost

![IMG_20220706_145631]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/IMG_20220706_145631.jpg)

I learned this lake is named after my great grandmother Pricilla (I think)

![IMG_20220706_155410]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/IMG_20220706_155410.jpg)

After the very steep last mile climb up the dirt road, we were there

![IMG_20220706_161201]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/IMG_20220706_161201.jpg)

We stayed one of the many cabins facing out over the lake.

And what is a visit to Mastigouche without going canoeing?

The bugs were really bad... especially when you're hiking through the woods
right next to a waterfall.

![IMG_20220707_174024]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/IMG_20220707_174024.jpg)

We made sure the Christy cabin was still standing.

It looks back on the main cabins across the lake.

We had dinner in the main lodge with the Koubek's.

After a few days, we battled our way down the dirt road and trekked our bikes
through the mud under the gate, with only minor casualties.
