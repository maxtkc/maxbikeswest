So many butterflies!

Update: end of day

I'm at a hotel in St Johnsbury. The day was going well, I did 45 or so miles by around 9 on pavement to the promised land, Canaan. After loading up on bananas, I got started on vtxl. It started off with a very long steep climb. I barely saw anyone for the first portion along the Canadian border. Then I saw a bear. This is the part of solo traveling that is scary, because I need to decide how to handle the situation, and if it goes wrong, it's definitely my fault. Fortunately, the bear ran off after a bit, and I could pass.

It was scary though. Also, the air quality was a lot worse than I had expected it to be from the forecast. My lungs were feeling pretty bad and I couldn't tell exactly why. Right as I was considering bailing out, I saw my first vtxl fellow rider. He was doing the whole 300 mile route non stop. ~~Inspired to continue~~yeah no I still bailed. My bailout was still decently hilly and gravel, because it's VT.

I know it's stupid to go to a hotel with just one person, but they have free breakfast. I can eat a lot right now. Not exactly sure what I'm doing tomorrow. If I do 100 miles, it's 1500 ft elevation. I didn't realize a lot of it is concentrated right in the center. I want to do what I can tomorrow and just keep going probably, if all goes well. The bugs are annoying and the bears are scary, but while riding these become less of an issue.
