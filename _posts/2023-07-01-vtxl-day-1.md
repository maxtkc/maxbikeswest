The bus dropped me off just short of Berlin, sun just under the horizon, replaced by an almost full moon. I decided to get a little ways towards the start of my route, riding almost 20 miles until I hit a dead end where my route tries to take me on a private road. My bright lights were great for keeping cars at bay, but we're little much when I took a wrong turn into a beach parking lot and surprised some people who were enjoying the darkness and lake without bathing suits. I quickly turned around, apologized, and decided to call it a night.

I'm learning to hammock camp... The temperature are a bit tricky. I didn't expect to actually need my sleeping bag, but I'm actually quite comfy in it. Tomorrow and the next night I'm expecting some rain, so I'm going to need to put up my fly properly with some rope so the rain doesn't pool or drip around the fly and pool at my butt. I'm a little concerned it's not wide enough... But we'll see. Every time I'm outside the hammock fiddling around it's open season for the mosquitoes.

It's already light out, so I know I should get moving, but it's real cozy in here. Goal is to do 120 miles today. I should get real close to the Canadian border for a bit, hope I don't take a wrong turn because I didn't bring my passport.

So many butterflies!

Update: end of day

I'm at a hotel in St Johnsbury. The day was going well, I did 45 or so miles by around 9 on pavement to the promised land, Canaan. After loading up on bananas, I got started on vtxl. It started off with a very long steep climb. I barely saw anyone for the first portion along the Canadian border. Then I saw a bear. This is the part of solo traveling that is scary, because I need to decide how to handle the situation, and if it goes wrong, it's definitely my fault. Fortunately, the bear ran off after a bit, and I could pass.

It was scary though. Also, the air quality was a lot worse than I had expected it to be from the forecast. My lungs were feeling pretty bad and I couldn't tell exactly why. Right as I was considering bailing out, I saw my first vtxl fellow rider. He was doing the whole 300 mile route non stop. ~~Inspired to continue~~yeah no I still bailed. My bailout was still decently hilly and gravel, because it's VT.

I know it's stupid to go to a hotel with just one person, but they have free breakfast. I can eat a lot right now. Not exactly sure what I'm doing tomorrow. If I do 100 miles, it's 1500 ft elevation. I didn't realize a lot of it is concentrated right in the center. I want to do what I can tomorrow and just keep going probably, if all goes well. The bugs are annoying and the bears are scary, but while riding these become less of an issue.
