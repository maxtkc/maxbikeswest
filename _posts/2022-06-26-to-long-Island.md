### Point Judith

![Rhode Island RT]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/img/Rhode_Island_rail_trail.jpg %})

Nina and I biked the 50 miles to Point Judith, getting there with over an hour to spare before our 1:30 ferry. We walked up and down the road looking for a place that sold anything vegetarian that could reasonably be a meal, and the only place we could find was called "Buster Krab's Grill & Beach Bar". Not only was there a veggie burger, but it had outdoor dining and cornhole!

On our way out, a lady dressed up for the beach coming into Buster Krabs pointed to my helmet and said, "does that stop cars from hitting you?". I couldn't really get what she was getting at, but I responded, "it might not stop them, but if I do get hit, it would help." She then followed with stories about how many of her friends had been hit and run while biking, and finally I realized she was confused about the light mounted atop my helmet. When I explained that it was a light, she responded, "well, maybe you should get a GoPro".

### Block Island

The cycling sloth has found it's perch on Block Island, where it is resting for it's following journey to East Hampton. It puts all the necessary resting items under it's cocoon, which it avoids exiting any more than necessary. This is one of the few times we can see the length of the fully outstretched arm, and thanks to our skilled national geographic photographer Nina who was lying stealthily in the grass 50 feet away, we now know sloths can actually extend their arms further if the rewards are great enough. This discovery has caused much excitement for sloth scientists all around the world.

The side that the ferry to Block Island lands on is very touristy, and it looks like many people are there for the day or week, but when we went to the next ferry just a few miles away on the other side, we found a completely different crowd. The ferry left from a restaurant on the end of a dock. There was not a single sign for the ferry, but we knew we had found it when we saw Viking Ferry written on the side of the large ferry towering over the restaurant. On just about every large yacht on the dock a number of people were enjoying the sun, drinking and hanging out on the decks of their boats. There was also a guy between yachts floating in a tube, drinking his beer. At the end of the dock, we weaved our bikes through the dispersed tables trying to figure out where the ferry was connected to the dock. On the 10ft wide end of the dock, the ferry nosed itself in just enough for the gangplank to make it to the dock at a 45 degree angle. We were fifteen minutes early, so the crew who may have been just out of their teenage years, only a few of whom were wearing Viking gear, we're still finishing their lunch. They were super friendly and helped us shove our bikes up the ramp and strap them to the ferry. I made sure to check when we started moving that we were in fact headed to Long Island. The ferry did make it there, finishing the trip spectacularly with a touch and go docking, first bouncing off of a pillar and a fellow Viking boat at a 45 degree angle before finally managing to shove the post until the boat pivoted into the slip and the post had fixed itself 15 degrees over. Maybe someday I could drive for them. It sounds like they do very little training, so it would be an easy career transition.

### East Hampton

Montauk and the Hamptons are quite interesting places. There are tons of fancy houses and fancy cars, but also a number of farms and lots of space. I've never seen anything like it before.

Took us a while to realize we could open the gate by just pressing the button.

We made it to Laura's house, where we were staying the night, just before sunset. She had just learned her daughter got COVID, so had very generously partitioned the house into two sides so we wouldn't be at any risk. Even with just half the house, trying to find the kitchen, Nina and I made it down a long hallway, before realizing it would be risky to go further as we might lose our way back. I think Laura had a little too much faith in our navigational abilities. I made it to the pool and we had a delicious dinner, and went to sleep early for the day ahead.

### Long Island

This morning, Nina and I parted ways, and I made my way through all of the various Hamptons. There are a few bike paths going east-west on long Island, although I think these are new. They are quite nice, although there are lots of rolling hills. There are also a number of roads with large shoulders, so even though the cars are going fast, they mark it as a bike lane.

Much of my route follows USBRS 25 and 25A, which are diligently signed.

I'm currently waiting at a pizza place for the heat of the day to pass a bit, and the headwind to turn directions a bit, before continuing. I have just 35 miles left!

### Even more pics

I managed to pack these into my frame pack so I could eat them while riding.
