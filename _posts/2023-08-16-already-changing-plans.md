I haven't packed this much on my bike since going across the country!

While we were originally planning on going to Nova Scotia, the timing was too tricky for that so we bailed and picked southern coastal New Brunswick. There are a number of small and often free ferries up there, and the great thing that comes with many ferries is many islands!

I had lunch in Bangor on my layover.

I'm currently on the West's Transportation bus on my way from Concord Coach in Bangor, ME to Whiting, ME, just ten miles from the Canadian border. While we have not picked up any other passengers, we have stopped for gas and a bathroom. The driver is very friendly and made some comments about Mo's volume, as she had driven Mo and my dad up to the same spot yesterday. I'm a day behind, so tomorrow I'll get up early and see if I can catch them on Grand Manan Island.

Because I didn't know when I'd join them, here's the detailed itinerary I sent:
